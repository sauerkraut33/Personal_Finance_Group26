Goal: 1. Visualizing how how financial pressures evolve from early adulthood through mid-life.
      2. Create a predictive model such that we can predict financial pressures of mid-life people from their early adulthood financial situation.

Defination: Financial Pressures: a combination value of Mortgage Debt, Student Loan Debt Credit Card Debt and Line of Credit Debt (shorten as PWDs)

Process:
1. Data Processing:
    1) Find ralated variables by checking correlations between variables and PWDs
    2) Clean variables (process abnormal data, record them and show how to deal with them)
    3) Produce coefficients needed by modelling section
2. Modelling:
    Create Predictive Model:
        1) Define financial pressure as a combination of PWDs such as a pressure index I = aPWD1+bPWD2+cPWD3...
        2) Create the model as a formula of financial pressure by related variables
        3) Derive coefficients needed from data processing section
3. Visualization:
    1) Correlation graph between each related variable and each related PWD
    2) ... and financial pressure
    3) variation trend graph of each PWD according to age
    4) ... of financial pressure ...
